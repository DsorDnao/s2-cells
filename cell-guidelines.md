# Useful levels

- Level 6: Ingress Cell level. These are the cells denoted ALPHA, ROMERO, etc.
- Level 13: EX Raid Gym Allocation
  - One EX raid gym will be promoted as a target per raid period, in each level 13 cell as of [03/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/7zyrkt/recent_ex_wave_now_uses_s2_cells_level_13/?st=jgszul5t&sh=8c178358).
  - EX potential gyms are gyms that are marked as parks on OpenStreetMaps.  Uuse the OSM tiles from iitc.me. Note: parks denoted after they generated their map do not count as parks for this purpose, use overpass-turbo to determine when your parks are created.
- Level 14: Gym allocation
  - 2-5 objects - 1 will be a gym
  - 6-19 objects - 2 will be a gym
  - 20 or more - 3 will be a gym
- Level 17: Pokemon Stop allocation. New stops will not be created in Pokemon Go, even if accepted and created in Ingress, if a point of interest (gym or stop) already exists in that level 17 cell. If counting for gym allocations, count 1 item per level 17 cell, even if there are multiple POI in the cell.
- Level 20: Ingress Portal allocation. New Ingress portals will not be created in Ingress, even if accepted in OPR, if a POI already exists in the same L20 cell.
