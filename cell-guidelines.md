# Useful levels

Note: Please do not misuse this tool (or any other tool) to place or move points of interest in the wrong cell for any reason.  This could result in an account ban, and at the very least, it's very rude for people actually trying to find these points of interest in the wild.  Suggested use of this tool is: choosing which points of interest to submit when several are close together, or carefully selecting the order to submit to create safe and enjoyable gyms. 

- Level 6: Ingress Cell level. These are the cells denoted ALPHA, ROMERO, etc.
- Level 13: EX Raid Gym Allocation
  - One EX raid gym will be promoted as a target per raid period, in each level 13 cell as of [03/18](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/7zyrkt/recent_ex_wave_now_uses_s2_cells_level_13/?st=jgszul5t&sh=8c178358).
  - EX potential gyms are gyms that are marked as parks on OpenStreetMaps.  Uuse the OSM tiles from iitc.me. Note: parks denoted after they generated their map do not count as parks for this purpose, use overpass-turbo to determine when your parks are created.  Note: more EX potential gyms than this are available as of late 2019.  The exact rules for new EX gym allocaiton is not clear.
- Level 14: Gym allocation.  Gyms are converted from stops first by most thumbs up count on the ingress photo. If all thumbs up in the region are identical, the oldest POI in the cell will become a gym.
  - 2-5 objects - 1 will be a gym
  - 6-19 objects - 2 will be a gym
  - 20 or more - 3 will be a gym
- Level 17: Pokemon Stop allocation. New stops will not be created in Pokemon Go, even if accepted and created in Ingress, if a point of interest (gym or stop) already exists in that level 17 cell. If counting for gym allocations, count 1 item per level 17 cell, even if there are multiple POI in the cell.

Ingress portal allocation: current online consensus indicates that accepted Ingress portals are created if they are at least 20m away from all current portals.
